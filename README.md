# Vision Language Model for Dietary Analysis

## Overview

**Vision Language Model for Dietary Analysis** is a cutting-edge application that leverages Google's Gemini Pro Vision API to analyze images of food and provide detailed dietary information. The app uses an advanced Vision Language Model (VLM) to identify food items in an image, calculate their calorie content, and deliver a comprehensive nutritional breakdown.

## Features

- **Image-Based Food Analysis**: Upload an image of your meal, and the app will identify each food item.
- **Calorie Calculation**: The app calculates the total calorie intake based on the identified food items.
- **Detailed Nutritional Information**: Get a breakdown of calories per food item for better dietary management.
- **Streamlit Integration**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy access and use.

## Technology Stack

- **Google Gemini Pro Vision API**: For food recognition and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the app interface.
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image handling and processing.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.
